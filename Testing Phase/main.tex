\section{Summary of Testing Methods}

\begin{itemize}
	\item We wrote three bash scripts that drove the majority of the performance testing. We combined these scripts in different orders to primarily generate:
	   \begin{itemize}
			 \item Average response times for particular \texttt{HTTP} requests, performed using the curl utility.
		   \item Load testing, in which we distributed the scripts across physical computers to attempt to emulate a typical usage environment. For this we used the majority of the SIT lab in the Informatorium.
	   \end{itemize}
	\item We used the networking utility \texttt{nmap} to determine open ports and other network vulnerabilities.
	\item We used the software Hydra to attempt to brute-force their \texttt{SSH} password.
\end{itemize}
